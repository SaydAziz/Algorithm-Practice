# Algorithm-Practice
Repo for Algorithms FA22 Class.

This project holds all algorithm examples created for the class Algorithms FA22. The Program.cs file will include seperate classes (ex: Assignment_1.cs) that are meant to be a seperate assignment containing the algorithms for that week. All algorithms are run in the Program class to showcase them when running the app.

Assignment 1 - Big O Notation
Assignment 2 - Fisher Yates Shuffle
Assignment 3 - Data Structures
