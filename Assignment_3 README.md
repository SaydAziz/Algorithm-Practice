Assignment 3 - Data Structures
    Array - Sets out a contiguous adjacent set of memory to store multiple elements of the same type. Insertion and deletion can occure at any index.
        > Use cases: Arrays can have duplicate values, and can be easily editted and iterrated through at anytime.
    Dictionary - Stores elements with a value and a key. The value is accesed by referencing the key that corresponds to it.
        > Use cases: Dictionaries have very fast lookups and do not have to iterrate in order to find a value.
    Stack - A data structure that uses the Last in First out principle. Your most recent entry into the stack is what will be used first. Insertion and deletion can only occur from the top of the list.
        > Use cases: Stacks are great for reversing an order of opperations, keeping track of most recent opperations, etc.
    Queue - A data structure that uses the First in Last out principle. Your most recent entry into the stack is what will be used Last. Insertion and deletion can only occur at the two ends.
        > Use cases: Queues are very efficient at supplying values in the order that they were added.This is great to preserve the order of certain operations to reference later on, and is super efficient at supplying them.
