Assignment 2 - Fisher Yates Shuffle
    > The Fisher Yates shuffle is a basic random shuffle algorithm that takes that decrements through a given list/array, and swaps the values from each index with
    a random other index between 0 and it's current index.
    > In the Assignment_2 class, I demonstrate the use of this algorithm by shuffling the printing loot items that are read from an external file.
