# Algorithm-Practice
Repo for Algorithms FA22 Class.

This project holds all algorithm examples created for the class Algorithms FA22. The Program.cs file will include seperate classes (ex: Assignment_1.cs) that are meant to be a seperate assignment containing the algorithms for that week. All algorithms are run in the Program class to showcase them when running the app.

Assignment 2 - Fisher Yates Shuffle
    > The Fisher Yates shuffle is a basic random shuffle algorithm that takes that decrements through a given list/array, and swaps the values from each index with
    a random other index between 0 and it's current index.
    > In the Assignment_2 class, I demonstrate the use of this algorithm by shuffling the printing loot items that are read from an external file.
